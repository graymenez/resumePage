        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="aboutMeText">My name is Corey. I have been an EMT for almost two years now. It is a great job, and I
            like it. How did I get into software Engineering? Well, as surprising as it may be to some, EMTs do not make
            great money. So, I began to create my own food truck business to accumulate more income. Everybody knows
            that every business needs an online presence, so I made a website through Wix. Creating something and seeing
            the results of how users interacted with it (even though getting a website through Wix isn't programming) is
            what had me. So I looked more in-depth of
            Software Engineering and had been intrigued ever since. </p>

                    we are expected to deliver great care for our patients in an Emergency setting and make
                    important decisions in highly stressful situations. Our Cheif and Action Care as a whole has
                    high expectations for the EMT's they employ. It's is an honor to work along side such great
                    people.
                    Team-work is highly important in this field and Action Care Ambulance tends to take care of
                    thier
                    own in that aspect.</p>
